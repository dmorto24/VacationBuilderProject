This is the vacation planning program designed by Megan Griffin and Drew Morton Spring of 2023 for Mobile/Web Design at John Brown University 2023.
The program is used to design a unique vaction for the user and build thier own vacation plans. There is no file organization in this project and all processes can be found in the main folder with the exception of the images of all the items, the CSS file, and JS files. If we had more time we could go back and better organize the file into folders like Admin, restaurant, survey, car, hotel, and activity but this would require lots of rerouting and debugging.
